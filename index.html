        <h1>WONDERS OF THE WORLD</h1>

        <h2>GREAT WALL OF CHINA</h2>
        <P>
            <h3> <i> <b>
                Great Wall of China, Chinese (Pinyin) Wanli Changcheng or (Wade-Giles romanization) 
                Wan-li Ch’ang-ch’eng (“10,000-Li Long Wall”), extensive bulwark erected in ancient China, 
                one of the largest building-construction projects ever undertaken. The Great Wall actually 
                consists of numerous walls—many of them parallel to each other—built over some two millennia 
                across northern China and southern Mongolia. The most extensive and best-preserved version of 
                the wall dates from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and runs for some 5,500 miles (8,850 km) 
                east to west from Mount Hu near Dandong, southeastern Liaoning province, to Jiayu Pass west 
                of Jiuquan, northwestern Gansu province. This wall often traces the crestlines of hills and 
                mountains as it snakes across the Chinese countryside, and about one-fourth of its length 
                consists solely of natural barriers such as rivers and mountain ridges. Nearly all of the 
                rest (about 70 percent of the total length) is actual constructed wall, with the small 
                remaining stretches constituting ditches or moats. Although lengthy sections of the wall 
                are now in ruins or have disappeared completely, it is still one of the more remarkable 
                structures on Earth. The Great Wall was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.

        <h2>TAJ MAHAL</h2>
        <P>
            <h3> <i> <b>
                The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river
                Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor 
                Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it 
                also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare 
                (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens 
                bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.Construction of the mausoleum was essentially 
                completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. 
                The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost 
                estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately 
                ₹70 billion (about U.S. $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000 
                artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the 
                emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site 
                in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired 
                masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of 
                Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million 
                visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World 
                (2000–2007) initiative.

        <h2>CHRIST THE REDEEMER</h2>  
        <P>
            <h3><i> <b>
                Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado in Rio de 
                Janeiro. Its origins date to just after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide 
                of godlessness.” They proposed a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva 
                Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was completed 
                five years later. The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters) tall—not including 
                its base, which is about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its outstretched arms span 92 feet
                 (28 meters). It is the largest Art Deco sculpture in the world. Christ the Redeemer is made 
                 of reinforced concrete and is covered in approximately six million tiles. Somewhat 
                 disconcertingly, the statue has often been struck by lightning, and in 2014 the tip of 
                 Jesus’s right thumb was damaged during a storm.

        <h2>COLOSSEUM</h2>
        <P>
            <h3><i><b>
                The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the Emperor Vespasian.
                 A feat of engineering, the amphitheater measures 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) 
                 and features a complex system of vaults. It was capable of holding 50,000 spectators, 
                 who watched a variety of events. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights, though 
                 men battling animals was also common. In addition, water was sometimes pumped into 
                 the Colosseum for mock naval engagements. However, the belief that Christians were 
                 martyred there—namely, by being thrown to lions—is debated. According to some estimates, 
                 about 500,000 people died in the Colosseum. Additionally, so many animals were captured 
                 and then killed there that certain species reportedly became extinct.

        <h2>MACHU PICCHU</h2>
        <P>
            <h3> <i> <b>
                This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, who
                 believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold used during the 16th-century rebellion 
                 against Spanish rule. Although that claim was later disproved, the purpose of Machu Picchu 
                 has confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the “Virgins of the Sun,” women
                  who lived in convents under a vow of chastity. Others think that it was likely a pilgrimage 
                  site, while some believe it was a royal retreat. (One thing it apparently should not be is 
                  the site of a beer commercial. In 2000 a crane being used for such an ad fell and cracked 
                  a monument.) What is known is that Machu Picchu is one of the few major pre-Columbian ruins 
                  found nearly intact. Despite its relative isolation high in the Andes Mountains, it features
                   agricultural terraces, plazas, residential areas, and temples.

        <h2>PETRA</h2>
        <P>
            <h3><i><b>
                The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote valley, nestled among sandstone 
                mountains and cliffs. It was purported to be one of the places where Moses struck a rock 
                and water gushed forth. Later the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and 
                during this time it flourished, becoming an important trade center, especially for spices. 
                Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, and tombs into the sandstone, 
                which changed color with the shifting sun. In addition, they constructed a water system that 
                allowed for lush gardens and farming. At its height, Petra reportedly had a population 
                of 30,000. The city began to decline, however, as trade routes shifted. A major earthquake 
                in 363 CE caused more difficulty, and after another tremor hit in 551, Petra was gradually 
                abandoned. Although rediscovered in 1912, it was largely ignored by archaeologists until 
                the late 20th century, and many questions remain about the city.

        <h2>CHICHEN ITZA</h2>
        <P>
            <h3><i><b>
                Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which flourished in the 9th 
                and 10th centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribe Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the 
                Toltecs—a number of important monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is 
                the stepped pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the 
                Main Plaza. A testament to the Mayans’ astronomical abilities, the structure features a 
                total of 365 steps, the number of days in the solar year. During the spring and autumnal 
                equinoxes, the setting sun casts shadows on the pyramid that give the appearance of a 
                serpent slithering down the north stairway; at the base is a stone snake head. Life there 
                was not all work and science, however. Chichén Itzá is home to the largest tlachtli (a type 
                of sporting field) in the Americas. On that field the residents played a ritual ball game 
                popular throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.
